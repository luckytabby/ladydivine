## About the Cavalcade

Lady Divine's Cavalcade of Perversion is a digital library of looks worn by Divine for various John Waters films. The Cavalcade was created both to fill a niche where no comparable resources currently reside and as a test of the CollectionBuilder framework. It is intended to celebrate and share the work and artistry of Divine, John Waters, and Van Smith.

The name of this digital library is derived from Lady Divine’s Cavalcade of Perversion, which is Divine’s traveling show in *Multiple Maniacs*, a caravan of filth where “we have it all and we show it all”.

## Fair Use

This collection is put together from screenshots of Waters’ films, which jives with fair use, as this is a student project featuring only very small snippets of each film.
