## About the Cavalcade

Divine was a drag queen and key creative partner and muse of filmmaker John Waters, “the Pope of Trash”. Divine–also known as Harris Glenn Milstead out of drag–starred in nine Waters films between 1967 and 1988. Lady Divine’s Cavalcade of Perversion is the name of Divine’s traveling show in Multiple Maniacs, a caravan of filth where “we have it all and we show it all”. Many of Divine’s iconic looks include gaudy jewelry and bold colors or prints, paired with her signature makeup and often featured in extended scenes where she promenades around town in Waters’ films.

This collection is put together from screenshots of Waters’ films.

## Contributors
Maggie McDonald is a current graduate student in the Master of Library Science and MA in Curatorship programs at Indiana University - Bloomington. They work at the Lilly Library in the Teaching and Research Department and with the Center for Conservation at the Eskenazi Museum of Art. They’re also a multidisciplinary artist, creating personal work and taking on selected projects through their home studio, Yearning Heart Studio.
 
Their academic and artistic interests include artists’ books, modern art, erotica, pleasure, surrealism, zines, fanfiction, fowl, and filth–an oeuvre into which John Waters’ films easily fit. They pulled this collection together because they realized that nothing like it existed while searching for fashion inspiration one fateful day. They were aided greatly in this work by their cat, coauthor, and muse, Mister Elvis Peppers.
