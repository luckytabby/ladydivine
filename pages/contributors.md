### Maggie McDonald

Maggie McDonald is a current graduate student in the Master of Library Science and MA in Curatorship programs at Indiana University - Bloomington. They work at the Lilly Library in the Teaching and Research Department and with the Center for Conservation at the Eskenazi Museum of Art. They’re also a multidisciplinary artist, creating personal work and taking on selected projects through their home studio, Yearning Heart Studio.
 
Their academic and artistic interests include artists’ books, modern art, erotica, pleasure, surrealism, zines, fanfiction, fowl, and filth–an oeuvre into which John Waters’ films easily fit. They pulled this collection together because they realized that nothing like it existed while searching for fashion inspiration one fateful day. They were aided greatly in this work by their cat, coauthor, and muse, Mister Elvis Peppers.
